<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Critics agree in saying The Fly Leaf fills a field
of its own.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is distinctive among all the Bibelots.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Footlights</span>,
Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It is a delightfully keen little swashbuckler.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Echo</span>,
Chicago.</p>

<p>The latest of the Bibelots. In my opinion it is the only one
of the lot, including the &#8220;Chap-Book,&#8221; &#8220;Philistine,&#8221; etc.,
which knows what it is driving at. The editor of the &#8220;Chap-Book&#8221;
toddles along, following or attempting to follow, the
twists and turns of the public taste&mdash;at least that is what he
wrote in a Note not long ago&mdash;and the editor of the &#8220;Philistine&#8221;
curses and swears, and devastates the atmosphere, trying his
best to kill everything. &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>&#8221; at once impressed
me that Mr. Harte knows what he wants, and seriously intends
to have it. I hope he will.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The North American</span>, Philadelphia.</p>

<p>It will pay any one who wishes to keep up with the literary
procession to peruse this sprightly little periodical.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Examiner</span>,
San Francisco, Cal.</p>

<p>That bright little bundle of anecdote, comment, essay, poetry
and fiction, &#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>,&#8221; of Boston, comes out in particularly
good style. It gives rich promise of many good things
to come.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Commercial Advertiser</span>, New York.</p>

<p>Number two of Walter Blackburn Harte&#8217;s dainty monthly
&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>,&#8221; is out, and filled with the spirit of youth
and beauty in literature, and zealous with culture, taste and
faith toward higher ideals, it is going about doing good.</p>

<p>Mr. Harte is strong, brilliant and brave as an essayist of the
movement, and is making friends everywhere. The poetry and
prose is all of high merit.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Boston Globe.</span></p>

<p>The thing I like about Mr. Harte is his splendid spirit of
Americanism, his optimistic belief in native literature and native
writers; his hatred of all things bordering on toadyism or servile
flattery of foreign gods to the exclusion of home talent. This is
the key-note of <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span>, and Mr. Harte will be apt to
say some trenchant, candid and always interesting things in its
pages.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Union and Advertiser</span>, Rochester, N. Y.</p>

<p>These are a few criticisms of the first two numbers, selected
from a great heap of enthusiastic notices. <span class="smcap">The Fly Leaf</span> is
promoting a Campaign for the Young Man in Literature. All
the young men and women in America are discussing its unique
and original literature, and spreading its fame.</p>

HOW TO SPEND MONEY.</p>

<p class="center">INTENDED FOR PERSONS OF SIMPLE TASTES<br />
WHO HAVE HAPPENED TO STRIKE TEN!</p>


<p>This is probably the last subject under heaven
I ever dreamed I should find occasion to discuss
in print. But we are the playthings of Fate,
and at this moment I am wholly immersed in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
weighty affairs and endless calculations as to
what my income would be if this bibelot of literature
became indispensable, as it undoubtedly
should be, in thousands of homes in this country.
When I have the figures satisfactorily arrived
at on the basis of ten thousand subscribers,
I see how easy it would be to introduce the periodical
to the friends and relations of these ten
thousand should-be delighted subscribers. Then
my figures are naturally inconclusive and, as my
wife says, with a fine belief in my destiny that
is quite irresistible, <i>absurdly modest</i>. Then I&#8217;m
bound to consider her figures, and her arithmetic
becomes more convincing with her wants.
She says that, out of a population of seventy
million souls, there must be at least one million
readers for the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/i_002.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>A woman who marries into Grub Street never
appreciates the situation quite so vividly as the
man who is to all intents and purposes born into
it. To begin with, she is naturally somewhat
prejudiced in her husband&#8217;s favor. I was foreordained
by Providence for a career in Grub
Street, and I could not marry out of it. A long
acquaintance with its chances has made me less
sanguine than my helpmate, and a million rather
staggered me. I know that only good dead
authors get a million readers, and then only in
stolen editions. So to keep my wife&#8217;s imagination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
within bounds I told her it was true there
were seventy millions in this country, but that
not even the most credulous acceptors of that
bad makeshift, human nature, would dream of
calling them seventy million <i>souls</i>. The huge
bulk was simply <i>the mob</i>! In the residuum
some <i>souls</i>, and perhaps half a million intelligent
people, were possibly to be found. Luckily
some sense of humor saves me from the temptation
of reckoning my possible gains in periodical
literature on the data furnished by the Census
Bureau.</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_003.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>But my wife, whose devotion to the severe
goddess of literature is somewhat vicarious, cannot
altogether stifle some pangs of envy as she
regards the fine new silk dress of the janitor&#8217;s
wife, or learns that Mr. So and So, who is in
the advertising business, has just given his wife
a new span of trotting horses for her new racing
cutter. This is enough to make a woman hiss
invidious things about the calling of literature.</p>

<p>A woman may love literature for her husband&#8217;s
sake, or even for its own, and yet she cannot
help looking into the haberdashers&#8217; and
milliners&#8217; windows with wistful hungry eyes.
And the goddess of literature does not allow her
votaries, especially the married ones, anything
but the shabbiest of shoddy drabs. So my wife
declares that one million out of seventy is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
moderate and conservative estimate, and she will
not abate the figures one jot or tittle. I am convinced
that the feminine love of finery and comfort
and elegance constitutes a temperamental
inadaptability to high aims in literature.</p>

<p>It all came about in this way: We were out
marketing&mdash;my better half and I&mdash;and we got
mixed up with the crowd of swell people pouring
into the main entrance of the opera-house,
and, as we passed under the brilliantly lighted
portico, my wife stopped a moment and peered
in to catch the name of <span class="smcap">Melba</span> on the billboard.</p>

<p>&#8220;We never go to see anything nowadays,&#8221;
she said, a little regretfully, as we moved on.
Then we crossed the street and joined the shopping
crowd, pushing and elbowing in opposing
streams on the other pavement, and presenting
an entirely different appearance to the radiant
throng about the opera-house. &#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; I
answered, &#8220;you can&#8217;t expect literature to prosper
in a year of financial panics, depreciated
dollars and war scares. We must be content to
just grub along.&#8221; &#8220;But I should like to hear
Melba and Calve&mdash;and I&#8217;ve not been to a single
Symphony this winter. Then, too, we&#8217;ve only
seen one play, and that was stupid. And we
couldn&#8217;t even afford to go up in the gods to see
Irving or Beerbohm Tree. It&#8217;s a shame the way
the speculators run the prices up for everything
good!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>&#8220;Well, you saw Otis Skinner in &#8216;Villon the
Vagabond,&#8217; and that was a good bit of romantic
acting.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, I know, but I do wish we didn&#8217;t
always have to go up in the gods.&#8221; &#8220;Get more
performances for your money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could turn dramatic critic now&mdash;and,
&#8217;pon my soul, I don&#8217;t see why not! The trick&#8217;s
comparatively easy. <i>My father</i> remembers the
great Edmund Kean, and I remember what he
says of him; and then there is theatrical literature
in abundance.&#8221; &#8220;Oh, no; there&#8217;s no fun
in seeing a play if you&#8217;ve got to go home and
write about it. You know that. But there is
no reason why we shouldn&#8217;t go to the opera and
sit in the best seats, if you only put all your
energy and lots of good things into what you
call your organ of civilization. Of course it
should succeed&mdash;and once the book lovers and
reading public know what it really is, it <i>must</i>
succeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And then&mdash;why, what shall we do with all our
money? I can&#8217;t think how we shall spend it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shan&#8217;t get too rich in a hurry. This is
the one direction in which you women have a
fine sweep of imagination&mdash;but it is not so easy
to make money as it is to spend it in imagination.
People don&#8217;t care for simply <i>good stuff</i> in
periodical literature, nowadays. It must intoxicate
them with the odor of blood, and I can&#8217;t do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
that&mdash;I can&#8217;t do Jack the Giant Killer stories.
I abominate anachronisms of mood in literature.
Fancy an old friar writing on modern sex problems!
But refined literary taste craves <i>gore</i>, and
plenty of it, and gore is sent by the shipload from
over the sea. The British make the best literary
butchers&mdash;it comes natural to them to hack
and chop and stab. The renaissance of blood
and thunder in fiction is the wonder of our age.
We cure any tendency to thinking by letting
blood, just as the old surgeons did all forms of
virulent disease a generation or so ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, but surely, there is just a big enough
public for good wit and good humor to make
our venture a success&mdash;and then with a million
readers we can hear Melba in the orchestra
chairs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A million&mdash;what an imagination you&#8217;ve
got! That would be a ten-strike!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why shouldn&#8217;t <i>you</i> have a ten-strike?
I&#8217;m sure you deserve it.&#8221; &#8220;All moralists do&mdash;but
ten-strikes do not go to the deserving.
Providence does not reward virtue in this fashion.&#8221;
&#8220;Then Providence should. I&#8217;m sure you
ought to succeed&mdash;and I&#8217;ve made up my mind
about it. We&#8217;ll do lots of things with our million.
I think we&#8217;ll begin by ceasing to buy our
tea where they give the crockery with it. But
tonight I want a little pitcher.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>&#8220;Then&mdash;just think!&mdash;I wouldn&#8217;t have to go
to the butcher&#8217;s and watch the scale to see
whether I get fair weight or not. I wouldn&#8217;t
care&mdash;I&#8217;d order by telephone, and I&#8217;d get the
very best parts of the meat instead of the <i>good</i>
parts, and you could eat the <i>fillet</i> of beef all the
time to build you up and make blood and brain.
You must hurry up and get that million.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_007.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m all right as it is, but I <i>do</i> like a tender
steak. And I think we&#8217;d quit something of our
enthusiasm for Boston baked beans, though I&#8217;ve
got quite to enjoy them. Still, it&#8217;s a sort of acquired
patriotism&mdash;and, like most forms of
patriotism, popular because it&#8217;s inexpensive.
Then we wouldn&#8217;t have frankfurters so often.
And we could begin to cultivate a taste for paté
de fois gras instead&mdash;although I think it looks
hateful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and we&#8217;d have enough table napkins
for unexpected callers.&#8221; &#8220;And ones for everyday,
too.&#8221; &#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t speak so loud about
such things in the crowd. I&#8217;m sure that woman
heard you&mdash;she stared so hard. Oh, and we&#8217;d
have silver rings for them!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Better get married again and see if we
couldn&#8217;t get a stock of silver this time. Generous
folk always load the rich down with plenty
of silver. At poor people&#8217;s weddings one sees
nothing but cake baskets.&#8221; &#8220;We got a brass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
lamp and some napkin rings.&#8221; &#8220;Did we? I
don&#8217;t remember; we must have lost the rings.&#8221;
&#8220;No; they turned brassy, and I didn&#8217;t dare to
put them on the table any longer.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I tell you what <i>I</i> should have, and I&#8217;m
sure I need it badly enough to get it immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; &#8220;Yes; you know, you guessed
it&mdash;a new dress&mdash;right away. And it should
have silk linings, finer on the inside than the
out, and real hair cloth, and&mdash;yes!&#8221; with a rising
inflection, &#8220;four godets in it! There! I
should buy no more Monday bargain coats.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I believe I would have my suits made
to order, and I should like some of those English
imported ties&mdash;the &#8216;purple moment&#8217; ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should only wear the very finest silk stockings.&#8221;
&#8220;You should&mdash;and red ones at that, to
gratify my aesthetic love of a flash of color.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another thing; I have enough to do as
guide, counsellor and friend; we&#8217;d get a girl to
help in the housework.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But we wouldn&#8217;t move into a larger house.
There is too much stuff in the cellar to dream
of moving, and we couldn&#8217;t abandon it&mdash;or <i>I</i>
couldn&#8217;t. Yes, by Jove! we&#8217;d move. I&#8217;d begin
to collect Posters and first editions, and I guess
we&#8217;d want more room.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s just a man&#8217;s selfishness to want a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
whole house to himself. Well, I want a parasol
which is a parasol, and not an umbrella in winter
as well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s only a trifle. When we go for excursions
in summer we&#8217;ll take the car down to
the very wharf. You know how mad you get
sometimes in summer when I try to persuade
you it&#8217;s more healthful to walk than to ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes? but we wouldn&#8217;t go for <i>excursions</i>.
We&#8217;d go to Newport&mdash;to Europe. You see how
prosperity saves bitterness of spirit by making
walking altogether unnecessary.&#8221; &#8220;That&#8217;s so&mdash;and
I&#8217;ll get shaved at the barber&#8217;s, and we&#8217;ll
have our portraits done by Aubrey Beardsley or
Whistler.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see&mdash;a box at the opera, the Symphony,
flowers&mdash;really, there must be more
ways of spending money than we&#8217;ve thought of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The only things I can think of are first editions,
Posters&mdash;and English ties.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll tell you what. You must set to
work and write a manual on &#8216;How to Spend
Money&#8217; at once, or we shall be perfectly miserable
and distracted with the consciousness of a
lack of yearnings when we get our million.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so; the best way to learn anything is
to write a book about it&mdash;and perhaps this may
be as true of spending a million as of anything
else.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>And so it has come about that I am to engage
in the labor of compiling a companion volume
to Benjamin Franklin&#8217;s admirable Poor Richard
book of precepts on economy and the wise conduct
of life. It appears to be almost as much
needed for people who lack the spending faculty
and imagination.</p>

<p>A lifetime of narrow and thrifty living has almost
entirely unfitted us for a life of luxury, and
chilled and benumbed our imaginations. There
must be other persons of severe and simple tastes
who have happened to strike ten, and want to
live up to it, and to such my &#8220;Lucky Richard&#8217;s
Manual&#8221; will appeal as a sort of moral salvation.
It will be indispensable and invaluable,
and it will be sold at a price that will put it
within the reach of persons of modest means as
well as of those who have struck ten. Everybody
in America has his own scheme for making
and spending a million, and mine will be sure
to be of comparative interest and value, for I
have only been rich in dreams. Like the &#8220;Proverbial
Philosophy,&#8221; &#8220;Lucky Richard&#8221; will find
a million readers. <span class="smcap">Walter Blackburn Harte.</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">LIFE AND DEATH.</h2></div>


<p>In the bedroom was a cradle; in the adjoining
room, dimly lighted and kept cool, was a coffin
loaded with flowers. There was the awful presence
of life and death.</p>

<p>The infant turned its head and cried as a young
woman bent over it, one hand pressing her breast
as if she was restraining her breath, and touched
its fair skin caressingly. The child&#8217;s tiny fist
struck blindly at the air, and getting fairly
awake he cried aloud. She drew back, pressing
her hands to her face, sighing in her heart.
The child blinked its blue eyes, and dozed off
again.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>The woman went into the other room, where
a man was praying at the coffin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, God! Oh, God! not this! Not this,
Oh, God!&#8221;</p>

<p>She sat down, away from the man, her elbows
on her spread knees, pressing her fingers into
her cheeks, gazing at him, at the coffin, at the
blurred mist of all this unreal reality.</p>

<p>The man moaned, &#8220;Oh, God! Oh, my God!&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled bitterly, making a gesture partly
of impatience, and with something of scorn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you no prayers&mdash;for the dead?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead! Oh, my God, dead!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, hush! Pray for the living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The living! The living? It is the fruit of
death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is death?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your child&mdash;lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My life is dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is but born.&#8221;</p>

<p>The woman looked at the pinched, faded face
of the corpse.</p>

<p>&#8220;The child is the soul of my death, and my
death lives.&#8221; He stood beside her at the coffin.
&#8220;This is death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, this is death.&#8221; Her voice was as if it
came from the tomb. &#8220;You loved her?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8220;Ah, I loved my wife better than all else in
life. Those cold eyes I kissed; those dry lips
kissed me; her folded hands held mine in love.
Only a man&mdash;only some men, can know what
that is to a man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will love your child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My love lies there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love is a terrible thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Love is death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know of love? Poor child,
you have never loved.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was never <i>loved</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, I was loved! Why do you weep? Who
knows not love can smile at suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>She shrank from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not touch me, I pray you! Respect&mdash;the
living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my child lives; does it not live? But
oh, my wife! You cannot know or guess how
a man loves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, I do&mdash;I do indeed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then look at me. She was my life, my first
real love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, restrain your tears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have never loved. She was all the
better part of me, or bore the burden of the
worse. She took me in growing manhood, she,
only a tender girl. She leaned to my first embrace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
she overlooked my failings and shared
my first struggles. After some years we married.
She said I was patient to wait. And then
we grew in life together, the weak strengthening
the weak. I used to dream of our growing
old together, dying together, and our loves living
on after us together, after having drawn us
nearer and making us dearer to God and each
other. Ah, me! that short life soon ended;
and now it is dead, dying in the dream of another
life in our child. And I saw the soft look
in the eyes of the mother harden under the cold
shadow of death. Do not weep for me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I, too, have loved. You do not know how
a woman loves. The base of eternity was the
love I builded on. I loved unspeaking, silently,
as a woman must; but I loved, and I would
have shared hell with the man I loved. I resisted,
fought against it and he never knew. Yet
I think he loved me once&mdash;is it impossible? I
felt myself mastered by the generous and godly
mind of a man; my weaknesses vanished in the
potency of his strength. And he may have
loved me&mdash;he may have loved me.</p>
<hr class="chap" />


<p>&#8220;But I saw another woman&#8217;s love for this
man. I knew the frail flower of her life was dying
in the want of sustenance for her love....
No, I did not love her; a woman does not love
so. Perhaps it was for pity of her, perhaps it
was for love of him, that I was impelled to offer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
myself a sacrifice. His was a man&#8217;s love.
Oh, yes, I know a man&#8217;s love rises to that height
at times where only a woman&#8217;s love constantly
abides. His was a man&#8217;s love, and soon he
loved her. Ah, I envied her, almost bitterly. I
sewed her bridal linen; it was a work of love
which she dreamed not of. I made the garments
for their first born; it was a holy duty of my
love. I laid her in her shroud. I envy her,
even now.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was as a man waking from a dream. He
took a step toward her, but she turned away.
He looked at the waxen face of the corpse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, it is terrible to die; but what is it to
live?&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">A NEW BILL OF THE SOCIETY FOR<br />
PREVENTION OF CRUELTY<br />
TO READERS.</h2></div>


<p>Some of the things our industrious writers of
today are doing, rather incline us to regret that
the craft has become so exemplary and respectable.
It may be that morality is served by the
reformation of Grub Street, but industry in literature
is rather a fearful thing when unaccompanied
by other qualities of mind; and a good
many contemporary writers are more industrious
than anything else. Indeed, it has occurred
to me, though I personally take nothing stronger
than tea, that a revival of loose living in the literary
world would be a God-send to discriminating
readers, as we might then cherish the hope
that some of our popular novelists would perish
ignominously, like poor Kit Marlowe, before
they could put in their cheap, slop literature on
the strength of their first bit of genuine work.</p>

<p>It is noticeable that of nearly all our contemporary
writers it is true that their best work was
done first in obscurity. With success came easy
writing and slop literature for the bag-men of the
syndicates. This is the most severe criticism
that can be made on them, for a writer who respects
himself should strive to continue developing
until forty. It is a pity some of our writers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
cannot meet a bad end early in life, for in that
case they would leave a fame unspoiled and unsmirched
with endless scamp work done for the
speculators in literary reputations.</p>

<p>If, perhaps, two-thirds of the present brood of
fiction writers had died, or been cut off in their
first flush, we should have just so much good
literature without being compelled to sift it out
of much &#8220;boomed&#8221; rubbish.</p>

<p>Max Nordau claims that the writers of today
are degenerates. As far as our literature is concerned,
the majority of our popular writers have
no such valid claim to serious consideration. It
is conceivable that degenerates may produce
priceless and imperishable literature. Our
writers are mostly merely sober and respectable
tinkers, and they imperil the intellectual development
of the race by coddling themselves
so well that they threaten to live as long as
Queen Victoria.</p>

<p>Indeed the glut of balderdash in the literary
market has become so serious and critical that
it seems to me some heroic measure is necessary.
I humbly suggest a measure that would,
in a radical and effective manner, meet the situation.
It is this: that a Censorship of Literature
should be established in connection with the
department of justice. The sole object of the
censorship would be the promotion of the best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
interests of literature. The censorship would
take the delinquents in hand, with a stern and
implacable majesty of law, that would indeed put
a premium on literary ambition and tempt only
the finest spirits and wits into the field.</p>

<p>The idea is this: At forty years of age every
successful literary man should be &#8220;removed&#8221;&mdash;and
by removal we imply the full significance
of the picturesque Oriental figure. To obviate
all chances, it would be fairly understood that
all literary careers ended at forty. There would
be no alternative of banishment or imprisonment.
It would be death in every case. This
would not be done to embarrass the production
of good literature, no matter how great the production
might become, for the world is big
enough, and humanity is slow and dull enough
to accommodate all the good literature the centuries
may bring forth. But the measure is
needed to prevent authors from destroying the
good influence of their first honest and strenuous
work and their own reputations. And this fate
would not deter the finest minds, for they would
be content to die with fame secure. But just
think of the beneficial and deterrent effect of
such an institution on the horde of scribbling
men and women who bury all the good literature
of our time under their huge mountain of
silly novels!</p>

<p>Women are the exceptions to every rule.
That is what rules are made for&mdash;so that women
can be exceptions to them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wickedness in women is expiated by the joy
it affords the saints.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all profess to think well of humanity because
we want to be well thought of.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is something to convert one&#8217;s enemies, but
the disillusion of life comes when one attempts
to convert one&#8217;s friends.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The definition of an immoral story in the eyes
of a certain caste of critics and the smugs is one
that has a moral.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A man who values his peace of mind marries
a plain woman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a good deal of literature about the
Woman with a Past. A woman has not got <i>a
past</i> until she begins the folly of repentance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is something radically wrong with a
misanthrope who is not merry and cheerful, for
this is a state of mental and moral independence
and self-complacency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another impending catastrophe that looms up
large on the literary horizon is a serial publication
of the innocuous, but insufferably tedious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
William Black. This is one of the most notorious
modern instances of a writer of fine abilities
who has fallen into the slough of mere money
making. Black ceased to write anything that
really seizes one&#8217;s interest almost as long ago
as ten years. He has written nothing but guide
and patter-book stories of the Scotch highlands
since his first legitimate successes, and today he
writes simply for the largest audience. The
style and workmanship is always up to his own
standard, for, of course, he is a good workman,
but the charm of a forceful and original mind
that we enjoyed in &#8220;Shandon Bells&#8221; and the
rest, is lacking in these later stories, in which
the conventional love story of old-fashioned romance
is told over and over again, with a background
of London and Scotch country houses.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mrs. Humphrey Ward is in the field again.
She is the female political and religious prophet
of the nonconformist many-headed. She is to
contribute an interminable, commonplace snob-novel,
dealing with utterly superfluous English
&#8220;society&#8221; and political life, to one of the American
magazines for mature sucklings. It is bad
enough to get this freak female in books.</p>

<p>It is a poor imitation of Anthony Trollope,
and it is filled with the profound platitudes that
have made the Ward nightmare a ludicrous libel
and parody of George Eliot. Such is the taste<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of the serious minded women readers of our
time, that this unendurably tiresome portrayer
of merely snob life and snob philosophy is hailed
as one of the geniuses of our age.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope I am a good Democrat here at home,
but in following English politics in the newspapers
I observe one intellectual characteristic of
a Tory government which touches my admiration
and enthusiasm, and inclines me to prefer
the Tories to the Liberals. The Liberals, like
the large army of &#8220;Reformers&#8221; we have with
us in this country, are rather apt to appeal to
the mawkish sentimentality of the unbalanced
and short-sighted masses, and they encourage
schemes for the reformation of human nature
by Act of Parliament. The Tories are saner,
broader and more tolerant of human failings
that are in the nature of things incurable. Perhaps
it is because they themselves do not pretend
to be wholly incorruptible on the moral
side that they have perception enough to recognize
the fact, that folly and wickedness are the
sole compensations of the lower orders for the
hardships of existence. The Lord save the poor
from the dispensation of the reformers and
moralists! I am glad to note that Lord Salisbury
has just turned down a deputation of fanatics
on the liquor question with the curt remark
that the subject did not attract the government<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
after past experience, and, moreover, the
government had other more important matters
to attend to. It is time these Prohibition lunatics
learned that free men will never relinquish
their divine and human rights to go to the
devil in their own way. And besides, liquor is
not by any means the worst evil in this world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is time Americans arrived at maturity of
judgment in intellectual matters, instead of
complacently occupying a position of servile dependence
upon English opinion. A declaration
of Literary Independence is needed, and must
soon be made by some bold spirits.</p>

<p>It is ridiculous to see the American cultivated
public taking all its opinions in literary matters
from the organs of British complacency and ancient
prejudice. <i>The London Times</i>, an ancient
bulwark of immovable Tory Know-nothingism,
is regarded seriously on this side. Then there
is the <i>Saturday Review</i>, a dirty gutter rag of
imbecile impertinence, which diverts the naturäl
&#8220;sports&#8221; and hobbledehoys of the British aristocracy.
It is written in choice English superciliousness,
by snobbish and half baked boys,
for English country houses, where the coagulation
of insular stupidity needs a whip and stable-boy
familiarities to set any wits in motion.
These astounding journals of civilization are
taken seriously by the American reading public,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and more especially by the critics, who will, with
very few exceptions, dance to any jig that is
played in London.</p>

<p>That the English &#8220;bag-men&#8221; of literature do
not fail to take advantage of American credulity
and servile deference to English opinion,
which is as easily counterfeited as &#8220;public opinion&#8221;
is here, is shown once more for the thousandth
time, by a recent statement in <i>The London
Times</i>. The English do not take any trouble
to dissemble their contempt of everything
American, and a good stirring spirit of retaliation
in every department, including literature
and criticism in this country, would increase
John Bull&#8217;s friendliness and tolerance as much
as Cleveland&#8217;s message on the Monroe doctrine
did in one astonishing fortnight. We <i>now</i>
learn the English <i>love</i> us! After all those
scurrilous articles in their magazines!</p>

<p>The <i>Times</i> says: &#8220;Nothing but a boom in
London will induce American publishers to
boom an author in the States. There are very
few literary journals in the United States, so
that ours have a remarkable influence, and their
verdict on a new work is eagerly scanned and,
as a rule, accepted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Well, it is time the literary journals we have
awoke to their duty and opportunity, and gave
up singing to English piping, and took to thinking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
for themselves. They might also look
around here, and learn something of their own
writers. It is really worth while to encourage
authorship in America. There is an abundance
of talent here, and, when circumstances are
favorable, real genius.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="figright"><img src="images/i_025.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>The howling of the critics and the frantic
female moralists convinced me that I must read
&#8220;Jude the Obscure,&#8221; which I might have postponed
until I was less busy, and so finally have
missed, as I have many good things&mdash;swept
on with the tide of events and affairs. But
when the frantic female moralist is stirred up in
holy indignation, I know that there is something
moving forward worthy of masculine consideration.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve read &#8220;Jude the Obscure.&#8221; It is the
comedy and tragedy of real human life. I have
no criticism. It seems Thackeray ought to have
lived to have remarked the literary successor of
Henry Fielding. I&#8217;m like Oliver Twist.
Alarmed at my own temerity, I want some more.</p>




<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let our English literature be written for men
and women. Let it dare, even if it can never
achieve the range of Balzac, the Aristophanes,
the Shakspeare of modern fiction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One very significant change has almost imperceptibly
crept into English fiction of recent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
years. It will be remembered that all Dickens&#8217;
and Thackeray&#8217;s heroines were in their teens;
only adventuresses and wicked women being allowed
a fictitious existence after passing their
twentieth birthday. And so with all the conventional
novels from that time to date&mdash;all
the heroines are sylphish, roguish, innocent, or
pale-faced, meditative maids. To-day the
heroines in some rather advanced books are allowed
to be as aged as twenty-five. This is
moral and intellectual progress. A woman is
now also allowed to be in love with a man before
he pops any question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The February &#8220;Bachelor of Arts&#8221; has an article
on &#8220;The Yale Prom [From the Girl&#8217;s Point of
View].&#8221; It is signed by &#8220;Florence Guertin.&#8221; In
the second paragraph we read: &#8220;Skirt the ballroom
with boxes; place in them hundreds of
pretty girls, typical American beauties from all
parts of the country; offset these by a fringe of
diamond-decked chaperones; confront them
with a solid phalanx of <i>white-shirted</i>, handsome,
muscular young men, and you have a
rough sketch of the outward aspect of the Junior
Promenade.&#8221; &#8220;White-shirted!&#8221; Why, Florence!
Is the Yale Prom such a barbarous, uncivilized
affair? This out-Poteats Mrs. Poteat,
who said she had rather send her son to hell
than to Yale (she was not a Harvard grad.,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
either). Our moral sensibilities are rudely disturbed
by this vision, but we struggle on for a
few paragraphs not knowing what awful disclosure
Florence will make next, till we heave a sigh
of relief when we read: &#8220;Yale University
teaches one thing not down in the curriculum:
it teaches a man how to dress. The majority of
students could pass a hundred in this course.&#8221;
From this we are led to infer that the solid
phalanx of handsome, muscular young men had
something else on beside white shirts, and that
there was more regard for the conventionalities
of modern civilization at New Haven than
Florence at first would have us believe. But
why &#8220;white-shirted?&#8221; Did Florence expect that
Yale men would appear in their dress suits with
colored shirts? Or perhaps she thought they
wore sweaters.</p>

<p>I do not know how it may be with other Epicureans,
but I find the complete dominance of
daily journalism, the stage, and a certain class
of magazines with a million readers apiece, by
the Fractionally-attired Female of the variety
stage or of society, is becoming distinctly nauseating.</p>



<p>To get the semi-nude fleshly female thrust
upon us in bulk at every turn, day after day,
awakens a fierce revolt in some masculine minds
against this insane worship of the Triumphant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
Harlot, which is fast growing to be the principal
characteristic of modern civilization. It is getting
to be a nightmare to all who cherish any
intellectual and moral ideal aims in life, and instead
of increasing the witchery of woman it
makes her a loathsome vacuous symbol of the
corrupt millions who are groaning and praying
for a Utopia of unrestrained bestial content.
I hope they may never throw off the yokes that
keep them tame&mdash;and out of my neighborhood.
This degradation of the stage and literature is
enough to create a race of Epicurean misogynists.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr. Edward Sanford Martin, in a department
called &#8220;This Busy World&#8221; in <i>Harper&#8217;s Weekly</i>,
expresses his strenuous disapproval of the
Bibelot movement in contemporary literature,
and of the aims of the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> in particular.
He says: &#8220;The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> is a periodical of the
New&mdash;not to say the &#8216;Fresh.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>I should have thought a man who has enough
love of <i>real</i> literature to turn to the good old
eighteenth century form of the gossipy essay,
as Mr. Martin has done in one or two books,
would have had enough sense of humor to appreciate
a sincere and honest attempt to rehabilitate
free thought, robust opinion and high endeavor
in present day literature. The revival
of the old and honorable pamphlet form, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
is and always has been the vehicle of free
thought, free fancy and the honest literature of
Democracy since the popularization of the printing
press should appeal to a bookman.</p>

<p>Mr. Martin is, however, a much better Tory
than he is a humorist; and to those who are not
aware of it, it is well to point out that one of
the significant developments in American literature
is the Tory spirit of a certain clique of
comfortables, who regard literature not as the
sacred tables of the human mind, but as a mere
game for people of taste. It is disappointing,
however, to find a man who shows his appreciation
of the good old school of essayists by attempting
to work out a career as one of this
scanty apostolic succession, so completely vitiated
in his critical and humorous perception by
bad company that he can only find a cheap, cant
term, borrowed from the gutter or the class-room,
for the honest work of men, who, in this age of
clatter and notoriety, are striving against odds
to bring in the ideals of the old robust English
literature.</p>

<p>But a Tory cannot be tolerant of Grub Street,
or stick at simple honesty in criticism. He is
bound to associate genius with prosperity, or
some of his friends&#8217; fame will suffer, and discriminating
readers will grow overbold in their
choice of polite literature. Fame depends nowadays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
on one&#8217;s appreciations of one&#8217;s well to do
contemporaries. It is the solemn business of
all &#8220;respectable&#8221; critics to keep literature as
the sacred gift and heirloom of a close corporation
of perfectly &#8220;respectable&#8221; and inoffensive
writers.</p>

<p>But perhaps time will bring a sense of humor
to Mr. Martin. We hope so, as we have a tenderness
for every man who cares for and writes
essays. Mr. Martin&#8217;s attitude surprised us somewhat,
as he really can write an amusing essay
and we expect much toleration from an essayist.
But he may live to grow mellow and learn to
love stout heretics. Every independent writer
since Job has appeared &#8220;fresh&#8221; to smug complacency,
and an essayist should never countenance
smuggery, if he would hold any status
with book men.</p>

<p>It always appears ridiculous to a clique that
other men should fight for and demand a hearing.
But we must honestly aver our egotistical
opinion that there is fully as much brains in
Grub Street, frowned upon as it is by the respectable
tin gods of contemporary criticism and
literature, as there is in other and more respectable
coteries of literature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The true ideal of a democracy is a natural
aristocracy of intellect, recruited in every generation
from all classes&mdash;the survival of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
fittest. But just now almost everything in our
social, intellectual, political, and even religious
activity, caters to the mass of lowest intelligences
and their gross prejudices.</p>

<p>In the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> the Beast will find no such
pandering to his muddy and addled brains.
There are plenty of periodical muck-heaps for
him to wallow in. This thing is intended for
our intellectual coevals and contemporaries, and
we shall not be easily convinced that, in this
seething time of wholesome change, there are
not enough such people in America to sympathize
with and support a periodical with such
aims.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> and its writers appeal to that
rare and delightful being, <i>the discriminating
reader</i>. Bookish folk constitute a division in
the human species, a class by themselves, and
as a Booklover as well as a quillfeather, I firmly
believe that only those who are possessed of
some intellectual and catholic interests of this
sort will be found human and worthy enough
to be admitted to Heaven. The Almighty will
surely not destroy his own peace by allowing
the fools to outnumber and outvote Him. The
dull and unintelligent deserve to be lost. An
acute philosopher (but why dissimulate to delude
the dull, since the philosophic quip is my
own?) has divided the human race into thinkers
and readers&mdash;and mere bipeds. Why remain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
simply a humble biped when you can read the
<span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span> and hope for Heaven?</p>

<p>It should be distinctly understood by all readers
who visit the book stores with the idea of getting
the most for their money, that the <span class="smcap">Fly Leaf</span>
cannot be put upon the scale and weighed
against the picture periodicals. It tips hopelessly
in the air, and this airiness and lightness
and intangible delicacy is the characteristic of
all <i>thought</i>. It flies into the air while mud settles
at once into its congenial mire. Thought
and wit and fancy always fly up in this fashion;
and this is the honor and distinction of the <span class="smcap">Fly
Leaf</span> and its staff, whether we win or lose.</p>

<p>We candidly do not appeal to the gross and
clumsy wits of the many-headed, although we
conserve the tradition of the democracy of fine
spirit in literature. Nature&#8217;s aristocracy of intellect
is all that makes humanity tolerable.
We appeal to the Remnant, without which democracy
would be the unmitigated dominion of
the Beast; and luckily we see evidences everywhere
of the rapid growth of this class and of
a salutary revolt against the dominion of the
Beast in journalism, literature, and even in politics.
Let it grow&mdash;for no nation can take its
proper place in civilization which is governed
by its tail instead of by its head.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE LONDON ACADEMY</h2></div>


<blockquote>

<p>The Leading Critical Literary Journal of London,
in a long review of &#8220;<span class="smcap">Meditations in
Motley</span>,&#8221; by <span class="smcap">Walter Blackburn Harte</span>,
says, among other things:</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;When any book of good criticism comes it should be welcomed
and made known for the benefit of the persons who care
for such works. The book under notice is one of these. It is,
so far as I know, the first from the author&#8217;s pen; but his writings
are well known, and those who read his present book will, with
some eagerness, await its successor. For it is a book in which
wit and bright, if often satirical, humor are made the vehicle for
no flimsy affectations, but for genuine thought. Mr. Ruskin has
affirmed that the virtue of originality is not newness, but genuineness.</p>

<p>&#8220;In this true sense Mr. Harte&#8217;s book is original. Here is
his own thought on several topics, pleasantly displayed, and no
mere echo or second-hand production of the ideas of others. If
Mr. Harte continues to act up to this sentiment, [a long quotation
from the book under consideration] as he does in the present
book, he may not achieve the triumph of twentieth editions, but
he will be a power for good&mdash;as every true man of letters is, and
must be in the world. If it were practicable I should be much
disposed to let the author recommend himself by giving copious
quotations from these essays. At his best&mdash;that is, in his most
characteristic and seemingly unconscious passages&mdash;he reminds
one of Montaigne: the charming inconsequence, the egotism free
from arrogance.&#8221;</p>
